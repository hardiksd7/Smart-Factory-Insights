# Smart-Factory-Insights
This project delivers an end-to-end predictive maintenance solution for Industry 5.0 using the large-scale Factory Sensor Simulator dataset. Our pipeline leverages Apache Spark for processing and Spark SQL for insights. We apply machine learning models, including XGBoost, to classify failure within 7 days and predict remaining operational life. The framework culminates in a custom-built UI that serves as an interactive hub. It allows users to run instant predictions on new datasets while visualizing overall fleet health and failure risks on a real-time Tableau dashboard. This empowers smart factories with a powerful tool for proactive, data-driven maintenance, minimizing downtime.
